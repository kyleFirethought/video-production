## How Decred Is Unique
### Voice Over Script

Decred is a cryptocurrency which builds upon the strengths of Bitcoin. To see how Decred is unique, let's compare the two.

Both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap.

Here's where things get interesting.

Bitcoin's mining subsidy is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.

Decred reduces its mining subsidy smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.

New Bitcoin blocks are found and broadcast by proof-of-work miners, who also receive 100% of the Bitcoin block reward. This gives miners all the power, leaving users without a way to stop miner attacks and prevent unwanted hard-forks.

Decred improves on this by utilizing a hybrid proof-of-work - proof-of-stake protocol. Proof-of-work miners receive 60% of the Decred block reward for finding blocks while Proof-of-stake voters receive 30% for keeping miners in check.

It works like this:

Every 5 minutes a new Decred block is found by a proof-of-work miner. Contained in each block are 5 block votes cast by proof-of-stake voters. These block votes are used to check the miner behavior of the previous block.

If a majority deems the previous block unwanted, the block's miner is stripped of their portion of the block reward as punishment for breaking the rules.

By allowing the rejection of invalid proof-of-work, Decred's hybrid protocol provides a mechanism for stakeholders to stop miner attacks and unwanted hard forks.

The differences don't stop there.

10% of the Decred block reward is placed in the project treasury. The project treasury makes Decred a self-funded open source project with no need for outside capital or an ICO.

How the project treasury is spent is determined by the stakeholders. Through Politeia, the Decred proposal system,  anyone can shape the future of Decred by proposing new ideas for stakeholder consideration.

Decred is controlled by its stakeholders. To become a Decred stakeholder go to Decred.org to download Decrediton for your platform and buy Decred on one of the many supporting exchanges.
