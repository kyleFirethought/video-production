 1 |Decred coin with 4 blue/green circuits extending from it on a deep blue background. The Decred coin 'unplugs' from the circuit to reveal a Bitcoin beneath it. Two of the circuits turn grey, the other two turn orange/yellow. The Decred coin 'plugs' back in and all circuits return to blue/green. | Decred is a cryptocurrency which builds upon the strengths of Bitcoin. To see how Decred is unique, let's compare the two.| 10 
 2 |Text: Decred & Bitcoin supply cap = 21 million coins | Both Bitcoin and Decred have a 21 million coin supply cap. Here's where things get interesting.| 8 
 3 |Stepped graph of Bitcoin mining subsidy over time. | Bitcoin's mining subsidy is reduced by 50 percent every 4 years as shown by this stepped graph.| 10 
 4 |Curved graph of Decred mining subsidy over time. | Decred reduces its mining subsidy smoothly and gradually by 1% every 21 days as shown by this curve.| 11

 7 |A Bitcoin user presents empty hands. | Leaving users without a way to coordinate and change the rules regarding what constitutes a valid block. | 8 
 8 |A chain of Bitcoin blocks builds across the screen forking in two directions as it goes. | This leaves open the possibility for unwanted hard forks in the chain. | 6 
 9 |A blue legal scale weighing Decred miners and participants. The Participants have more weight than the miners. | Decred improves on this by utilizing a hybrid proof-of-work - proof-of-stake system. | 7 
 10 |A pie chart with 60% and 30% wedges highlighted. | Proof-of-work miners receive 60% of the Decred block reward for finding blocks while Proof-of-stake participants receive 30% in return for casting votes. It works like this. | 13

13|5 PoS participants appear opposite to the miner| Contained in each block are 5 votes cast by proof-of-stake participants. These votes are used to check the miner behavior of the previous block. | 10 
 14 |The participants votes are cast. 3 of 5 of the votes are no. The miner loses some dcr. | If a majority deems the previous block unwanted, the founding miner is stripped of their portion of the block reward as punishment for breaking the rules. | 10 
 15 |a 51% attack and unwanted hard fork are stopped. | By allowing the rejection of unwanted blocks, Decred's hybrid system provides a mechanism to stop miner attacks and unwanted hard forks. The differences don't stop there. | 13 
 16 |Back to pie chart, this time the 10% wedge is highlighted. | 10% of every Decred block reward is placed in the network fund. | 6 
 17 |VC and ICO funding are rejected. | The network fund makes Decred a self-funded open-source project with no need for outside capital or an ICO. How the network fund is spent is determined by participants. | 14
